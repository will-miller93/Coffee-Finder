// this is where the nav anchor will be. just the parent 
// <nav> tag. inside that element will be a list and then 
// all of the elements required in the nav.
// will need some sort of if statement I think
    // there will either need to be an if statement in here
    // to find out if the user is at the dash or the map
    // to load the appropriate elements
    // or the conditional would be on the pages.
    // and the Nav Anchor would not load any elements here.
