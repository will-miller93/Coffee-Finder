// this file will have all of the socket.io functionality to add things to the Database.
// this will also have all of the Express Server stuff here too.
// this will also have the MiddleWare here too. 

// the backend of this app is an Express server and utilizes Socket.io
// so that everyone using the app can see new shops that are popping up as
// they are added.

// this means that the socket emitter will probably need to be
// in both pages components.
